### BabyLizard Tutorial 

In this basic BabyLizard utorial we are going to demonstrate how to create a custom battery.

#### Step1: Creating a Mod

Lets start by creating a mod first to store our battery

This will allow us to add extra functionality to a simulation component

- Launch Unreal Engine
- Open up the Baby Lizard project
- Press the "Create UGC" button on the toolbar
- Give your new mod a name and press "Create Mod"

Next we need to create a new battery blueprint

On the content folder of our new mod we created:

- Right-Click and create a new blueprint
- Under all classes, search for BskSimpleBattery
- Press the "Select" button and give your blueprint a name

Below is the blueprint graph for out battery

If you are not familiar with Unreal Engine, we sugest watching the official tutorial:

- [Intro to Blueprints: Blueprint Introduction | 01 | v4.8 Tutorial Series | Unreal Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFXMW_UEDco)

The left panel shows the simulation events and variables that our custom battery uses

In the example we are creating a battery that has a leak on it's charge by updating the final message
